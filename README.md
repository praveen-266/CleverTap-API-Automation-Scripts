# CleverTap-API-Automation-Scripts

Welcome to this repository showcasing automation scripts for the CleverTap API! ðŸš€

**About CleverTap**

CleverTap is a powerful customer engagement and analytics platform that helps businesses deliver omnichannel experiences to their users. Its robust API allows developers to programmatically access and manipulate data, enabling advanced automation and integration possibilities.

### Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to automate various metrics and processes using the CleverTap API. These scripts streamline data extraction, analysis, and reporting, saving time and providing valuable insights for marketers and developers alike.

### What This Repository Contains:
In this repository, I've developed and implemented Python scripts that automate the process of fetching critical user engagement metrics from CleverTap, such as:
- **Event Tracking**: Automating the retrieval of user interaction data based on specific events (e.g., signups, form submissions, etc.).
- **User Segmentation**: Filtering users based on multiple event conditions and channel-specific attributes.
- **Data Processing**: Efficiently processing large datasets, handling pagination via API cursors, and storing results in structured formats (e.g., Excel).
- **Scheduled Automation**: Scripts that run daily, pulling updated metrics automatically without human intervention.

### Key Features
